# Prototype level narrative texts

Was used in playtest 20251123. I made some polishing when transcribing it into this doc.

## Card play phase - round 1

The Veydrin diplomat arrives in their race's signature unstable material form: fast and subtly changing shape, shimmering sillouette. She is shifting between 3 probable faces... or is it 4? 5? You cannot tell. But you can tell she is trying to come up with a human-friendly face.

She quitely slides into your premium customer's table set. She reaches your sight lines with elegance a bit hollow to the touch.

She starts talking. "Honorable owner of the Emporium, it is a pleasure to have your attention upon my needs in this lovely rise." Her biotech translator delivers her words loyally to you - well, as loyal as the interglactic languages and communications act requires - in a calm, worldly human female voice with restrained excitement. "I bear a purpose just like any of your other customers. But for a start, I wonder if you could show me your famed skill of stability?"

## Card play phase - round 2

"Spectacular. I heard about it from many sources, but seeing it in person is a much more elevated experience." The diplomat becomes about 20% more transparent.

You vaguely remember your 3rd grade classmate did this whenever he let down his guard a little bit.

You clear your throat gently before replying. "I, uhh, I am glad. Actually humans are all good at this, I just have a couple of simple tricks on top of that. And I guess most species are more stable than Veydrins..." Quickly realizing this might not be a flattering thing to say, you awkwardly continue: "Umm I mean phasal shapeshifting is cool, and if I can do that I would turn myself into a sponge and..."

The diplomat's life nuclei contract a little at first, but then resumed their usual pulsing. "I suppose that is true." She ponders on something for a split second and starts to speak in multiple voices at once, with her "head" tilting slighly to the right. "Then this skill of yours must be able to endure phase shifts in our current spacetime, no? I cannot wait to observe your adaptabtability and resilience!"

## Card play phase - round 3

The diplomat squints. Her "hair" starts to flow in a radiative way instead of the earlier bonfire way. Something in the dish you just cooked must have fueled some new idea in her. Hmmmm, could it be that she noticed the lizard teeth you grinded and mixed in the rice? You now regret cutting corners on the rice. And you did not even know what kind of lizard was that.

But the cooking does not seem to be her focus at all. "As intriging as rumored, I see. Such firm control in determinism. I shall bring an equal amount of showmanship to the table to respect your beatiful orchestration." She smoothly disintegrates like an ash flower, and reforms into a different humanoid figure. When the dancing dust particles settle, you notice it is the person you can see any time through a mirror. You have not done so in quite a lot of cycles, because... oh let's not repeat what your therapists say to you again.

"Now how about we see how you can play this game when facing your own, what do you people call it? Right, poker face." She says cheerfully.

## Narrative puzzle phase

### Giving basic rewards

Diplomat: "This is truly impressive. Calling me enlighted is an understatement."

<Grants +10 insigts, rare cookware ingredient Veydrin Phasebud>

Diplomat: "Next, if I read the dining manual correctly, I can consult your opinion on a matter of any nature, is that true?"

You: "Aha. Right, I totally remember adding that into the manual. So you see that is because I have this cat like pet, who is not really a cat, that claims to know everything except for how to shut up, and has OCD in talking about what it knows. So I hear it yapping about matters from all the system and one day it..." Suddenly you get knocked on the head by a wool ball that comes out of thin air. "Hey I was just getting to the good part", you wave your fist at a dark corner of the room and then remembers you have a customer to serve, "Ahem. Yes, I mean, of course, let's get to that step!"

You snapped your fingers. This premium suite's background changes to a cozy star-bath house on a beach on the Veydrin home planet. The diplomat's "hair" flows melodically backwards now.

Diplomat: "Wonderful. I would like to discuss recent conflicts between our nation and Hydrune Clan Theta. I am sure you have heard the news." 

She hands you some info slabs.

Diplomat: "Here are the most relevant pieces as I see it. But can you tell me your view?"

### Fill-in-the-blanks

[Start fill-in-th-blanks puzzle game. Like in the Golden Idol games, but with dropdown options instead of drag-and-drop words. Clues can be obtained by reading environment texts and winning clue fragments in card play rounds.]


Conclusion 1: The Hydrune Clan Theta has increased their patrol around ___. This is not typical behaviour.

1. Radiant Rift
2. Tide Archives <- correct option
3. Border Shallows
4. Western Heights

Conclusion 2: If the Veydrin Prime Ministry interprets it, they may assume it means ___, which would put pressure on you, the Chief Diplomat, to support harsher action.

1. surrendering gesture
2. military preparation <- correct option
3. internal schism
4. resource hoarding

Conclusion 3: However, according to Hydrune culture and Clan Theta history, they are more likely preparing for ___, not confrontation. You could gather more intel before advising, or use this opportunity in other ways that benifit you individually.

1. tide song ceremony <- correct option
2. stealth assault
3. evacuation
4. research acceleration

[Player makes choices. These puzzles are optional, not filling all blanks correctly only leads to less extra rewards.]

Diplomat: "You are indeed very insightful/stratigic/creative (\<this depends on how well the player does in the puzzle\>). I understand your stance. But one final question." She paused a bit. "What is another people's culture to you, as an outsider?"

### One final dialogue with consequence

[Player can choose from several dialogue lines.]

A. You: "A spiritual pillar, one that prevents escalation." You speak with some enthusiasm. Not for anyone to hear though; that era of your life has long passed.

B. You: "As a mere curator of a quirky emporium, I can do nothing but insignificant trades. If there are materials or remnants that could help me improve my bussiness, I would be happy to protect them." You shrug. "You know, by buying them."

C. \<Needs extra clue $\ge$ 2\> You: "You already know. The actual reason you are here is your doubt in unnatrual signals in the reports you recieve. Noises, vortexes, disrruptions of pattern. Manipulation." You wipe wine glasses as you nonchalantly utter those words. "The Emporium will not do anything with this information, and anything in this suite stays forever in this suite." You stop briefly and pull up a hologram of the dining manual. "Ah yes, I really put that in the manual." Then you return to your cleaning work.

**Consequences of choosing A, B and C**

A. Diplomat advices deescalation. She gets re-assigned to a remote, unimportant outer post. Veydrin prime ministry increases naval presence around Hydrune Clan Theta's territory. Tension rises but no wars yet.

B. Diplomat advices military action. Veydrin prime ministry increases naval presence around Hydrune Clan Theta's territory. Wars were fought. Diplomat is rewarded handsomely.

C. Diplomat says: "You noticed too." Her tone is more of a relief than a surprise. She does not say any more, and just politely bids you goodbye. That night she defects quitely. In the next few major cycles, you will hear some say she became the system's foremost alien expert on tide songs, some say she vanished into the deep archives and resurfaced in lawless zones to hunt for artifacts. Some Hydrune regulars say she did the impossible: permanantly stablize.

Whether that is true or not, you don't have the motive to know, nor do you think you should. Your little emporium, or exotic diner, whatever you like to call it, sits at the edge of the system, and welcomes its next premium customer as usual.
