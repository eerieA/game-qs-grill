# Prototype level narrative texts

Was used in playtest 20251123. I made some polishing when transcribing it into this doc.

## Card play round 1

The Veydrin diplomat arrives in their race's signature unstable material form: fast and subtly changing shape, shimmering sillouette. She is shifting between 3 probable faces... or is it 4? 5? You cannot tell. But you can tell she is trying to come up with a human-friendly face.

She quitely slides into your premium customer's table set. She reaches your sight lines with elegance a bit hollow to the touch.

She starts talking. "Honorable owner of the Emporium, it is a pleasure to have your attention upon my needs in this lovely rise." Her biotech translator delivers her words loyally to you - well, as loyal as the interglactic languages and communications act requires - in a calm, worldly human female voice with restrained excitement. "I bear a purpose just like any of your other customers. But for a start, I wonder if you could show me your famed skill of stability?"

## Card play round 2

"Spectacular. I heard about it from many sources, but seeing it in person is a much more elevated experience." The diplomat becomes about 20% more transparent.

You vaguely remember your 3rd grade classmate did this whenever he let down his guard a little bit.

You clear your throat gently before replying. "I, uhh, I am glad. Actually humans are all good at this, I just have a couple of simple tricks on top of that. And I guess most species are more stable than Veydrins..." Quickly realizing this might not be a flattering thing to say, you awkwardly continue: "Umm I mean phasal shapeshifting is cool, and if I can do that I would turn myself into a sponge and..."

The diplomat's life nuclei contract a little at first, but then resumed their usual pulsing. "I suppose that is true." She ponders on something for a split second and starts to speak in multiple voices at once, with her "head" tilting slighly to the right. "Then this skill of yours must be able to endure phase shifts in our current spacetime, no? I cannot wait to observe your adaptabtability and resilience!"

## Card play round 3

The diplomat squints. Her "hair" starts to flow in a radiative way instead of the earlier bonfire way. Something in the dish you just cooked must have fueled some new idea in her. Hmmmm, could it be that she noticed the lizard teeth you grinded and mixed in the rice? You now regret cutting corners on the rice. And you did not even know what kind of lizard was that.

But the cooking does not seem to be her focus at all. "As intriging as rumored, I see. Such firm control in determinism. I shall bring an equal amount of showmanship to the table to respect your beatiful orchestration." She smoothly disintegrates like an ash flower, and reforms into a different humanoid figure. When the dancing dust particles settle, you notice it is the person you can see any time through a mirror. You have not done so in quite a lot of cycles, because... oh let's not repeat what your therapists say to you again.

"Now how about we see how you can play this game when facing your own, what do you people call it? Right, poker face." She says cheerfully.
