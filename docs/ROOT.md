Toy prototype that is a Balatro-like. With very similar systems, but adding some different flavor. Overalll would have a goofy scifi vibe.

Below is the full form tempory name and the rationale behind it.

## Temprory name

`Phineas's Quasi-Stellar Luxodo Emporium & Grill`

So it can be shortened to be `PhQSLEG`, which can be pronounced like "fix leg". But most in-game characters just call it "Phineas's", especially regulars.

### Rationale

#### 1. The Core Vibe: Confident Absurdity

The primary goal of the name is to encapsulate the game's core tone: a gameplay loop that is strategically deep and intelligent, presented within a universe that is charmingly goofy, casual, and doesn't take itself too seriously. The name is designed to be a "welcome mat" that filters for players who will appreciate this blend of sci-fi and comedic weirdness.

#### 2. The Rhythm and Length: A Folksy, Nerdy Tall Tale

The name is deliberately long (6 words). This is not a bug. Its length rejects modern, minimalist naming conventions and instead embraces the feel of a rambling, folksy business title from a bygone era. It has a natural, bouncy rhythm that makes it memorable and fun to say:

**(Phineas's) (Quasi-Stellar Lu'Xodo) (Emporium & Grill)**

> Luxodo is pronouced with more emphasize on the second syllable.

This structure makes it sound a bit like the name of a real, quirky place you could visit - the kind of place a space-faring rogue would tell you about in a grimy cantina.

#### 3. Deconstruction of the Name

Each component of the name is carefully chosen to contribute to the overall effect through contrast and reference.

*   **"Phineas's": The Genius Showman**  
    This name operates on two layers.
    *   **The Surface Layer (P.T. Barnum):** "Phineas" immediately evokes Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum, the legendary 19th-century showman. This sets the stage for an "Emporium" run by a charismatic, perhaps untrustworthy, huckster - a master of spectacle and chicanery.
    *   **The Deeper Layer (Richard Feynman):** The Barnum reference is a clever mask for a nod to Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Feynman was renowned not just for his genius, but for his playful, mischievous, and anti-authoritarian spirit. He was, IMHO, **the P.T. Barnum of theoretical physics** - a showman whose product was brilliant, complex truth. This name suggests the proprietor is a secret genius who presents himself as a simple trickster, perfectly mirroring a game that is much deeper than its goofy exterior suggests.

*   **"Quasi-Stellar": The Cosmic Grandeur**  
    This is the "sci-fi" anchor of the name. A "Quasi-Stellar Object" (Quasar) is an extremely luminous and powerful celestial body.

*   **"Luxodo": The Failed Grandeur**  
    "Luxodo" is a deliberately crafted piece of the puzzle. It’s a made-up word that transparently signals a clumsy attempt at luxury and class.
    *   The **"Lux-"** root immediately brings "luxury" to mind.
    *   The **"-odo"** suffix has a vague, cheap-sounding flair, reminiscent of "Tuxedo" or a faux-European branding attempt.
    This word is funny precisely because it's trying so hard to sound impressive and failing. It perfectly characterizes the owner as someone with big dreams but perhaps questionable taste, reinforcing the lovable, underdog nature of the establishment.

*   **"Emporium & Grill": The Final Punchline**  
    This is the core comedic contrast that brings the whole name together.
    *   **"Emporium"** follows through on the promise of "Quasi-Stellar Luxodo" - a large, fancy establishment offering a wide variety of fine goods.
    *   **"& Grill"** immediately and hilariously punctures that pretension. It grounds the entire cosmic, luxurious enterprise in the humble, greasy-spoon reality of a diner. This collision promises a world where you can gamble with the fate of star systems, but also order a burger and fries. It is the ultimate expression of the game's high-concept, low-brow personality.

## Rough core game idea

Felt like the galactic menu builder and life coach idea is easier. So there is a FP + Insight economy. Usually 2 main phases per level: card play, narrative puzzle.

- Card-based “cooking” gameplay (Balatro-style combo system), gives money and narrative clues (clue fragments)
- Short narrative puzzle phase (Ace Attorney and Golden Idol inspired, 3–4 decisions)
- Dual reward design: persistent cookware vs. temporary spice
- Light world consequence through ambient narrative flags

Narrative Puzzle (Dialogue Phase)

Reward & Consequence (Synthesis Phase, optional)

```

There may be an overarching main story connecting different characters' short stories. Not sure if for a first game that would be too ambitious.
