# Toy prototype that is a Balatro-like

Toy prototype that is a Balatro-like. With very similar systems, but adding some different flavor. Overall would have a goofy scifi vibe.

`Phineas's Quasi-Stellar Luxodo Emporium & Grill`.

Currently set in the [Nexarion](https://github.com/eerieA/game-nexarion) universe I imagined.
