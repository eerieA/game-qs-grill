# Narrative Micro-Puzzle Templates

1-Minute Golden Idol x Ace Attorney style mysteries. Temporary idea, might get axed very soon.

## 1. Core Design Goals

Each micro-puzzle must be:

*   **60–90 seconds to solve**
*   **Text-only**, no UI complexity
*   **Satisfying deduction** from a *single contradiction or missing link*
*   **Directly linked to card-play output**
*   **Rewarding but not mandatory**

Think: *one riddle-like situation, 2–4 clues, 1 clean answer.*

---

## 2. Puzzle Structure (The Grammar)

Each puzzle uses the following blueprint:

### A. Scenario Hook

A short, punchy dilemma from a customer, courier, guild member, or official.

### B. Clue Fragments

These come from:

*   Card-play tags (e.g., “fluid,” “volatile,” “earthy”)
*   Heat range goals
*   Special cookware effects
*   “Dialogue snippets” earned in previous sessions

You reveal **3–4 textual clues**, each 1 sentence.

### C. Puzzle Question

One of:

*   *Who did X?*
*   *What is the contradiction?*
*   *Which ingredient/cookware was used incorrectly?*
*   *Which statement is false?*
*   *What object is missing?*
*   *What timeline event is out of order?*

### D. Answer Set

Always exactly **3 choices** (A/B/C), Golden-Idol style.

### E. Reward

*   +Insight
*   Ingredient
*   Narrative progress flag
*   Cosmetic unlock
*   New customer or special request
